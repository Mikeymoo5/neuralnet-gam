Have you ever bought a pet simulator game, just to realize it was boring? What if your virtual pet could be considered alive? Introducing: NEURALNET-GAME (rebrand coming soon!)

Challenging the definition of "sentient" and "alive," NEURALNET-GAME uses reinforcement learning to provide a virtual pet with a virtual brain, allowing your pet to "live," which provideds an incentive to keep taking care of it. 

# TODO
- [x] Finish Gymnasium environment
- [x] Implement general TensorFlow functionality
- [x] Switch to Pytorch because general tensorflow functionality means no functionality at all because tensorflow lacks an observer library for windows
- [ ] Finetune training settings
- [ ] Comfort features
  - [x] Full click support for easier training
  - [ ] IN PROGRESS - Replayability to watch model progress
  - [x] Game element (player interaction with the model - placing food and water around the map)
