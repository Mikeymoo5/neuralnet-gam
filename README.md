## NOTE: This project is currently in an unfinished state; Not all functionality has been added yet

# TODO
- [x] Finish Gymnasium environment
- [x] Implement general TensorFlow functionality
- [x] Switch to Pytorch because general tensorflow functionality means no functionality at all because tensorflow lacks an observer library for windows
- [ ] Finetune training settings
- [ ] Comfort features
  - [x] Full click support for easier training
  - [ ] Replayability to watch model progress
  - [x] Game element (player interaction with the model - placing food and water around the map)
